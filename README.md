# MALL-CUSTEMER-SEGMENTATION-USING-KMEANSE-CLUSTRING.
Mall Customer Segmentation using K-Means | Data Analysis Project (BCA 3rd Sem) Machine learning project that segments mall customers into groups based on age, income, and spending score using K-Means clustering. Built in Python with visualization for better business insights.

# 🛍️ Mall Customer Segmentation using K-Means

## 📘 Overview
This project aims to analyze mall customer data and group customers into distinct segments based on their behavior patterns. By applying **K-Means Clustering**, we can identify target groups for marketing and business strategy.

This is my **first data science project** completed as part of my **BCA 3rd Semester** under the guidance of **Smita Desai**, Bhartesh College of Computer Applications, Belagavi.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- To understand customer distribution and spending habits.
- To apply **K-Means clustering** for customer segmentation.
- To visualize and interpret the clusters for business insights.

---

## 🧠 Key Concepts
- Machine Learning (Unsupervised Learning)
- K-Means Clustering Algorithm
- Data Visualization using Matplotlib and Seaborn
- Data Preprocessing and Feature Scaling

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
| Tool | Purpose |
|------|----------|
| **Python** | Core programming language |
| **Pandas & NumPy** | Data manipulation |
| **Matplotlib & Seaborn** | Data visualization |
| **Scikit-learn** | K-Means model implementation |
| **Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab** | Development environment |

---

## 📊 Steps Involved
1. Import the dataset (`Mall_Customers.csv`)
2. Explore and visualize the data
3. Apply **Elbow Method** to find the optimal number of clusters
4. Perform **K-Means clustering**
5. Visualize the final clusters
6. Analyze the characteristics of each segment

---

## 📈 Results
The model segmented customers into different clusters based on:
- **Age**
- **Annual Income**
- **Spending Score**

These clusters help identify:
- High spenders
- Budget customers
- Average spenders
- Low engagement customers

---

## 📜 Sample Output
--- text
Cluster 0: High Income - High Spending
Cluster 1: Low Income - Low Spending
Cluster 2: Young Average Spenders
Cluster 3: Mature High Spenders
Cluster 4: Low Income - Average SpendinG
